00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Mr. Blue, I told you that I love you, please believe me

00:14.000 --> 00:25.000
Mr. Blue, I have to go now darling, don't be angry

00:25.000 --> 00:36.000
Know that you're tired, know that you're sore and sick and sad for some reason

00:36.000 --> 00:47.000
So I'll leave you with a smile, kiss you on the cheek and you will call it treason

00:47.000 --> 00:58.000
Mr. Blue, don't hold your head so low that you can't see the sky

00:58.000 --> 01:10.000
Mr. Blue, it ain't so long since you were flying high

01:10.000 --> 01:21.000
That's the way it goes some days, a fever comes at you without a warning

01:21.000 --> 01:33.000
I can see it in your face, you've been waiting to break since you woke up this morning

01:33.000 --> 01:44.000
Mr. Blue, don't hold your head so low that you can't see the sky

01:44.000 --> 02:07.000
Mr. Blue, it ain't so long since you were flying high

02:07.000 --> 02:21.000
Mr. Blue, Mr. Blue

02:37.000 --> 02:51.000
Mr. Blue, I told you that I love you, please believe me
