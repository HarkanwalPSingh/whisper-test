1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Mr. Blue, I told you that I love you, please believe me

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Mr. Blue, I have to go now darling, don't be angry

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Know that you're tired, know that you're sore and sick and sad for some reason

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So I'll leave you with a smile, kiss you on the cheek and you will call it treason

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Mr. Blue, don't hold your head so low that you can't see the sky

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Mr. Blue, it ain't so long since you were flying high

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's the way it goes some days, a fever comes at you without a warning

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I can see it in your face, you've been waiting to break since you woke up this morning

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Mr. Blue, don't hold your head so low that you can't see the sky

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Mr. Blue, it ain't so long since you were flying high

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Mr. Blue, Mr. Blue

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Mr. Blue, I told you that I love you, please believe me
