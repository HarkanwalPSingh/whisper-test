00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
For you it's a bit like you

00:07.000 --> 00:16.000
For you it's a bit like you

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Forgive me, take another option

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
I won't come back here, I don't want to give you an exception

00:23.000 --> 00:26.000
So much that I gave you the champion

00:26.000 --> 00:32.000
When I needed you, you saw your worst version

00:32.000 --> 00:36.000
Sorry baby, a while ago

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
That I saw you because of that cat

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
A wolf like me is not for everyone

00:44.000 --> 00:50.000
A wolf like me is not for you like you

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
For you like you

00:54.000 --> 00:58.000
For you it's a bit like you

00:58.000 --> 01:07.000
For you it's a bit like you

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
This is to make you more sick

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
More sick, more sick

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
I won't come back here, I don't want to cry

01:14.000 --> 01:17.000
I won't come back here, I don't want to give you an exception

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
So much that I gave you the champion

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Sorry baby, a while ago

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
That I saw you because of that cat

01:23.000 --> 01:28.000
A wolf like me is not for you like you

01:28.000 --> 01:33.000
For you it's a bit like you

01:33.000 --> 01:39.000
For you it's a bit like you

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
For you it's a bit like you

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
For you it's a bit like you

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
Clearly it's more like you

01:57.000 --> 02:00.000
For you it's a bit like you

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
For you it's a bit different

02:03.000 --> 02:08.000
That is why you're with an equal photo

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I love you a lot, I too love you

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
You won't come back here, I won't come back here

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
I won't come back here, I don't want to cry

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I won't come back here, I don't want to cry

02:18.000 --> 02:19.500
I don't even know what happened to you

02:19.500 --> 02:21.500
You're so weird that I don't even distinguish you

02:21.500 --> 02:23.500
I walk by 2 of 22

02:23.500 --> 02:25.500
You changed a Ferrari for a Twingo

02:25.500 --> 02:27.500
You changed a Rolex for a Casio

02:27.500 --> 02:29.500
You're going to be a high school student

02:29.500 --> 02:31.500
Ah, a lot of gym

02:31.500 --> 02:34.000
But I also work a little bit of my brain

02:34.000 --> 02:35.500
How much do you owe me?

02:35.500 --> 02:36.500
Here I feel full

02:36.500 --> 02:37.500
For me everything is fine

02:37.500 --> 02:39.000
I take care of you tomorrow

02:39.000 --> 02:41.500
And if you want to bring her to you, come too

02:41.500 --> 02:44.500
She has a person name

02:44.500 --> 02:45.500
Good

02:45.500 --> 02:49.500
It's not how it sounds to me

02:49.500 --> 02:53.500
It's not a good person name

02:53.500 --> 02:56.500
And a student like me is no longer for you

02:56.500 --> 02:59.500
Like you

02:59.500 --> 03:03.500
For you, like you

03:03.500 --> 03:05.500
For you it's getting bigger

03:05.500 --> 03:08.500
And that's why you're with a little igualita

03:08.500 --> 03:19.500
Like you

03:19.500 --> 03:21.500
For you it's getting bigger

03:21.500 --> 03:24.500
And that's why you're with a little igualita

03:24.500 --> 03:29.500
Like you

03:29.500 --> 03:39.500
That's it, bye
