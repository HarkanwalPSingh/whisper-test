1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For you it's a bit like you

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,000
For you it's a bit like you

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Forgive me, take another option

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I won't come back here, I don't want to give you an exception

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So much that I gave you the champion

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
When I needed you, you saw your worst version

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Sorry baby, a while ago

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That I saw you because of that cat

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
A wolf like me is not for everyone

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
A wolf like me is not for you like you

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
For you like you

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
For you it's a bit like you

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:07,000
For you it's a bit like you

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This is to make you more sick

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
More sick, more sick

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I won't come back here, I don't want to cry

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I won't come back here, I don't want to give you an exception

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So much that I gave you the champion

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Sorry baby, a while ago

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That I saw you because of that cat

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
A wolf like me is not for you like you

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
For you it's a bit like you

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
For you it's a bit like you

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
For you it's a bit like you

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
For you it's a bit like you

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Clearly it's more like you

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
For you it's a bit like you

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
For you it's a bit different

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That is why you're with an equal photo

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I love you a lot, I too love you

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You won't come back here, I won't come back here

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I won't come back here, I don't want to cry

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I won't come back here, I don't want to cry

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,500
I don't even know what happened to you

35
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,500
You're so weird that I don't even distinguish you

36
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
I walk by 2 of 22

37
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
You changed a Ferrari for a Twingo

38
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,500
You changed a Rolex for a Casio

39
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
You're going to be a high school student

40
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Ah, a lot of gym

41
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,000
But I also work a little bit of my brain

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,500
How much do you owe me?

43
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
Here I feel full

44
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,500
For me everything is fine

45
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,000
I take care of you tomorrow

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,500
And if you want to bring her to you, come too

47
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,500
She has a person name

48
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Good

49
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,500
It's not how it sounds to me

50
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,500
It's not a good person name

51
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
And a student like me is no longer for you

52
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,500
Like you

53
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,500
For you, like you

54
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
For you it's getting bigger

55
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,500
And that's why you're with a little igualita

56
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Like you

57
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,500
For you it's getting bigger

58
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,500
And that's why you're with a little igualita

59
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Like you

60
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:39,500
That's it, bye
