32000	36000	Sorry baby, a while ago
36000	40000	That I saw you because of that cat
40000	44000	A wolf like me is not for everyone
44000	50000	A wolf like me is not for you like you
50000	54000	For you like you
54000	58000	For you it's a bit like you
58000	67000	For you it's a bit like you
67000	69000	This is to make you more sick
69000	71000	More sick, more sick
71000	74000	I won't come back here, I don't want to cry
74000	77000	I won't come back here, I don't want to give you an exception

104000	110000	For you it's a bit like you
110000	117000	Clearly it's more like you
117000	120000	For you it's a bit like you
120000	123000	For you it's a bit different
123000	128000	That is why you're with an equal photo
130000	132000	I love you a lot, I too love you
132000	134000	You won't come back here, I won't come back here
134000	136000	I won't come back here, I don't want to cry
136000	138000	I won't come back here, I don't want to cry
138000	139500	I don't even know what happened to you
139500	141500	You're so weird that I don't even distinguish you
141500	143500	I walk by 2 of 22
143500	145500	You changed a Ferrari for a Twingo
145500	147500	You changed a Rolex for a Casio
147500	149500	You're going to be a high school student
149500	151500	Ah, a lot of gym
151500	154000	But I also work a little bit of my brain
154000	155500	How much do you owe me?
155500	156500	Here I feel full
156500	157500	For me everything is fine
157500	159000	I take care of you tomorrow
159000	161500	And if you want to bring her to you, come too
161500	164500	She has a person name
164500	165500	Good
165500	169500	It's not how it sounds to me
169500	173500	It's not a good person name
173500	176500	And a student like me is no longer for you
176500	179500	Like you
179500	183500	For you, like you
183500	185500	For you it's getting bigger
185500	188500	And that's why you're with a little igualita
188500	199500	Like you
199500	201500	For you it's getting bigger
201500	204500	And that's why you're with a little igualita
204500	209500	Like you
209500	219500	That's it, bye
